## Info:
This assignment was more practice in pulling information from API's, using javascript to generate html elements, and more practice in local storage
## Some Problems Faced:
With only slight issues in using my API's, my main problem was in figuring out how best to store the data generated on the page in a way that was repeatable. I believe if I was more comfortable in my use of objects, all the pieces would come together much more readily. This will definitely be an assignment for me to go back over with a fresh mind and more tools at my disposal
